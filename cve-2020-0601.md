# CVE 2020-0601 AKA "Curveball"
A spoofing vulnerability exists in the way Windows CryptoAPI (Crypt32.dll) validates Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) certificates.An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by using a spoofed code-signing certificate to sign a malicious executable, making it appear the file was from a trusted, legitimate source, aka 'Windows CryptoAPI Spoofing Vulnerability'.

## Analysis Notes
"Curveball" is an exploit that attempts to make a signed binary appear like it was signed by a trusted and legitiate source. In the event that this event is triggered, analysts should begin looking back through the Application log to identify recently executed binaries and validate their signatures and behavior. 

You can validate a Windows binary signature using Powershell.
```
Get-AuthenticodeSignature -FilePath "suspicious_file.extension"
```
