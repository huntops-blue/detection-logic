# KQL Queries
The [Kibana Query Language](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/kuery-query.html) is a standardized query structure that makes it _generally_ easier to ask Kibana questions. It does provide for standardized queries and, in conjunction with the [Elastic Common Schema](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/ecs/current/index.html)(ECS), allows you to easily share Kibana queries with the community.
